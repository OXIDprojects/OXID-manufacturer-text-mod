# Manufacturer long description for OXID eShops CE
Add a fulltext long description for manufacturers to your oxid eShop.  

Unfortunatly OXID eShops just have a (very) short description field for manufacturers,
this is where this module comes in and adds a long text description field.  
You even can add a RichText Editor to it.  

## Installation
- Run the migration.sql on your database (Backup all data before you do, just in case)
- Rebuild views: Service -> Tools -> SQL -> "Views jetzt updaten"
- activate module: "Erweiterungen -> Module -> Ivo Bathke: Manufacturer Description"
- in the settings of the module you can choose where to show the descriptions.   
  You can choose between above the list, in the locator or below the list.  
  This module can also manage where you show the category short & long descriptions in the same way as for manufacturers.

If you use https://github.com/vanilla-thunder/bla-tinymce Editor, add  
"manufacturer_description" in the "bestlife TinyMCE" configuration for backend classes.

## Usage
After you have activated the module, you will find a tab "Description" in your manufacturers under:
"Stammdaten -> Hersteller".  
Enter your description there.
