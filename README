Manufacturer Long text for OXID eShops CE (build in 4.5.1)

Run the migration.sql
Rebuild views:
Service -> Tools -> SQL -> Views jetzt updaten

You can copy all files from the copy_this folder to their respective location,
if you have a vanilla 4.5.1 OXID eShops CE installation.
Other versions are not tested yet. 

Enable module to handle fulltest as raw:
oxmanufacturer => ext_oxmanufacturer

Enable Frontend module to set $actCategory->oxcategories__oxdesc->value to the long text on all occurences:
oxmanufacturerlist => ext_oxmanufacturerlist

Or get the value in the template nativly, then you dont need to enable the above module:
f.e. [{$actCategory->oxmanufacturers__oxlongdesc->value}]

Clear /tmp

CAUTION:
Due to the -notsonice- module integration, your OXID installation is now not easy updatable anymore.
This is particulary because of the modification of menu.xml and the admin template cust_lang files.
But as i believe this should be a core feature, this shouldnt be seen as a module anyway.
