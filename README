Manufacturer Long text for OXID eShops CE (build in 4.5.1)

Run the migration.sql
Rebuild views:
Service -> Tools -> SQL -> Views jetzt updaten

You can copy all files from the copy_this folder to their respective location,
if you have a vanilla 4.5.1 OXID eShops CE installation.
Other versions are not tested yet. 

Enable module to handle fulltest as raw:
oxmanufacturer => ext_oxmanufacturer

Enable Frontend module to set $actCategory->oxcategories__oxdesc->value to the long text on all occurences:
oxmanufacturerlist => ext_oxmanufacturerlist

Or get the value in the template nativly, then you dont need to enable the above module:
f.e. [{$actCategory->oxmanufacturers__oxlongdesc->value}]

Or copy it manually:
 
lang:
out/admin/de/cust_lang.php & out/admin/en/cust_lang.php
insert in array:
'tbclmanufacturer_text'   => 'Text'

BEWARE:
I switched encoding to UTF-8!

menu:
admin/menu.xml
Insert:
<TAB id="tbclmanufacturer_text" cl="manufacturer_text" />
under:
<SUBMENU id="mxmanufacturer" cl="manufacturer" list="manufacturer_list">

Copy controller:
manufacturer_text.php
to:
admin/manufacturer_text.php

Copy template:
manufacturer_text.tpl
to
out/admin/tpl/manufacturer_text.tpl

Clear /tmp


CAUTION:
Due to the -notsonice- module integration, your OXID installation is now not easy updatable anymore.
This is particulary because of the modification of menu.xml and the admin template cust_lang files.
But as i believe this should be a core feature, this shouldnt be seen as a module anyway.
